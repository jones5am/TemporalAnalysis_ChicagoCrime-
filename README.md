Temporal Analysis on Chicago Crime data

Please note that for full disclosure and honestly I must indicate that this project was created as part of a group. However I did take a leading role in the R programming behind the project and fully understand all pieces of the markdown file. I did take part in the presentation creation as well, however the focus of this project was always intended to be the coding and analysis.
